Part 1 Submission:
I worked with Ismail to test my server. He and I came up with different test
cases, such as clients sending messages to themselves, and clients sending
partial messages to each other, that needed to be accounted for.

Part 2 Submission:
Ismail and I did more work testing together. He and I both helped each other
find cases that we hadn't considered. I forgot to disable self-messaging,
and I helped him find an issue where he wasn't buffering HELLO messages
correctly.
